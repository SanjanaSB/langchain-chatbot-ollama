# LangChain Chatbot with Ollama, Gemma3n and LangSmith

This project is a chatbot built using the LangChain framework. It uses Ollama to run the Gemma3n large language model locally on your system.

The chatbot processes all data locally, ensuring privacy and faster responses without needing any external API keys or cloud services.

Features include:
- Integration of LangChain with a local LLM via Ollama
- Use of the Gemma3n model for natural language understanding
- Modular design for easy customization and extension

Instructions to run the project and install dependencies are provided inside the repository.
